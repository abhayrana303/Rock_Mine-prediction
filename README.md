# Rock_Mine-prediction
This is the Machine Leaning Practice project. In this project, I used logistic regression Machine Learning Alogorithm to detect the whether object is Rock or Mine from the help of Sonar Data.
I collected data from Kaggle and used in my project.
In this project, I handeled missing values, using train_test split algorithm separate data into training and testing, train the Logistic Regression, and predict the sample input.
